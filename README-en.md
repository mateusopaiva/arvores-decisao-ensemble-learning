## 📂 Description
The Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning course provided a deep understanding of some of the most effective techniques in Machine Learning to increase predictive power across a variety of applications.

Decision trees and their derivatives stand out for their ability to intuitively handle complex data, offering a balance between interpretability and performance. During the course, the concept of cost function was explored, along with techniques to mitigate overfitting, which can compromise model effectiveness.

In addition, the course covered the use of Ensemble Learning, demonstrating how combining multiple models can lead to superior results. The RandomForest model, in particular, proved to be one of the most robust and reliable solutions for tackling challenging data problems.

With this theoretical and practical foundation, the course provided an excellent opportunity to understand how these models can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as financial risk analysis.

## 📊 Projects

### 🏫 Credit Analysis with Machine Learning

In this project, the Random Forest technique was used to predict loan defaults on a Peer to Peer Lending platform. The goal was to analyze user data and, based on various factors, predict when a loan would not be repaid.

This project applied the knowledge gained from Random Forests to create a predictive model, considering factors relevant to credit risk and users' financial health.
